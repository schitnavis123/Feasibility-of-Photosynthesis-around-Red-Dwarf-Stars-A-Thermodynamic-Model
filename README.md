Files ending in .ipynb are the python codes. When you run the code you should obtain .txt files and .png files (which I have uploaded too) 
Beware that there are several copies of some .txt files (e.g. there are 6x 'fp_2800K.txt') in different folders. This is due to issues in finding the original path...
...essentially, if you update one of these files know that it wouldn't have updated in the other copies of it!
